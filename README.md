---
This package can build queries for elasticsearch database and provide an easy way to add Eloquent models to an elasticsearch index.

It is not trying to provide Eloquent-like api to work with elasticsearch. instead it will give you methods that are much like writing a query in elasticsearch but in a more object oriented and nicer way.

I'm developing this package in a use-case driven approach (I add features as I need them in on my projects) but if you feel the need of a method or feature feel free to open an issue and I will try to implement it as soon as possible.
