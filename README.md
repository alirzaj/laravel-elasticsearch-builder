---
This package can build queries for elasticsearch database and provides an easy way to add Eloquent models to an elasticsearch index.

It is not trying to provide Eloquent-like api to work with elasticsearch. instead, it will give you methods that are much like writing a query in elasticsearch but in a more object-oriented and nicer way.

this package contains the queries that I needed on my projects. so if you feel the need of a method or feature please open an issue, and I will try to implement it as soon as possible.

## Installation
