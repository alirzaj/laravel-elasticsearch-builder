---
This package can build queries for elasticsearch database and provide an easy way to add Eloquent models to an elasticsearch index.
This package is not trying to provide Eloquent-like api to work with elasticsearch. instead it will give you methods that are much like writing a query in elasticsearch but in a more object oriented and nicer way.

## Testing
